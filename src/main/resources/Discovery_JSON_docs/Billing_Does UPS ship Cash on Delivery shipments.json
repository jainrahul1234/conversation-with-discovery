        "body": "If you ship cash on delivery, consider UPS Capital C.O.D. Secure. Your customers' Cash on Delivery payments are automatically transferred into your bank account, generally two to three business days after shipment delivery. Since there are no physical checks to process, you'll reduce monthly fees, and--in the event that one of the checks is dishonored upon deposit--UPS Capital will pay you for that item, up to a specific limit.",
